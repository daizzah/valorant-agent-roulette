# Agent Roulette ðŸŽ²

Agent Roulette is a playful and visually themed web app built for **Valorant duos** who can't decide which agents to play. It helps randomly assign agents to each player with fun styling and lighthearted animations.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ Randomly selects two different agents from the full Valorant roster.
- ðŸŽ² Re-roll buttons for each player to individually randomize a new agent.
- ðŸŽµ Includes sound effects and subtle animations for a more fun experience.
- ðŸŽ¨ Custom, soft pinkâ€“purple aesthetic with themed icons and responsive layout.

## How It Works

1. Click the **roll again** button to start.
2. Two agents are randomly chosen and displayed with their images.
3. Each player has the option to re-roll their assigned agent.

> This tool is meant to be a fun, decision-making helperâ€”not for ranked sweats (unless you're brave).
